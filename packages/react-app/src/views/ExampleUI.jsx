        <p>Welcome to Quarterly Bonus!</p>

        <p>This game accumulates 10% of your buyin *this round* every day.</p>

        <p>A round ends when the contract balance is depleted. You then need to buy in again, therefore this contract is more sustainable than its peers. It does NOT promise returns forever.</p>

        <p>Buy in and withdraw each have a fee of 10%. That is typical for a game like this. What is not typical is what I have chosen to do with this 10%:</p>

        <p>1% is burned. Roughly 7.7% is the developer's fee. The rest goes into the Quarterly Bonus.</p>

        <p>What's the Quarterly Bonus? As the game is played, the Quarterly Bonus pot grows. At the end of 3 months, this pot is split EVENLY between all players.</p>
        <p>This feature was impossible to test on the testnet, but this is how I intend it to work and since we have an immutable ledger, I will manually compensate players if my code has a bug.</p>

        <p>I am NOT a web developer, so I'm aware this website doesn't look great. Thank you for your patience while I make it look better and be more informative.</p>
